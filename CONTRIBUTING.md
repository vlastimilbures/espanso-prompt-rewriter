# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Espanso Prompt Rewriter. Bug reports, prompt-quality findings, new
redaction patterns and documentation fixes are all welcome.

## Before you start

- For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
- Never put real API keys, customer data or confidential text in code, tests, issues or commits.
  Use obviously fake values (`sk-test…`, `4111 1111 1111 1111`, `john.doe@example.com`).
- Security problems, including ways around the data-protection gate, go through
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not public issues.

## Set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlastimilbures/espanso-prompt-rewriter.git
cd espanso-prompt-rewriter
uv sync                  # the project plus its dev tools
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Checks

Run these before opening a pull request. CI runs the same.

```bash
uv run pytest                                   # unit tests, no network
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy                                     # strict, src and scripts
uv run pre-commit run --all-files               # also YAML checks, gitleaks and zizmor
```

If you change a screen of the interface (`src/prompt_workflow/tui/`), its SVG snapshots fail
until you regenerate them, review the new SVGs and commit them (Linux or macOS):

```bash
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 uv run pytest tests/test_tui_snapshots.py
```

If you change a prompt, a provider or anything on the request path, also run the opt-in live
tests (needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`, costs fractions of a cent):

```bash
uv run pytest -m live
```

## Ground rules

- **The Espanso contract.** The CLI prints the result with no trailing newline, and every failure
  as `[prompt-workflow: …]` with exit code 0. Espanso cannot show stderr or exit codes, so a
  traceback or a blank line reaches the user as a silent failure. Print only through
  `cli._emit()`, which strips control and invisible characters from whatever gets pasted.
  `tests/test_trigger_contract.py` compares the whole stdout of `improve` and `persona` byte
  for byte; a change there is a change to what every trigger pastes. On Windows each newline
  in the output is printed as CRLF (Python's standard streams translate it there); the test
  expects that.
- **The gate.** Build providers only through `factory.make_provider()`. It wraps every provider
  that can send the draft off the machine in `GatedProvider`: the cloud ones always, a local one
  when its base URL is not loopback or the Ollama model is a cloud model.
- **Cross-platform.** Everything must work on macOS and Windows. Use `pathlib` and explicit
  timeouts.
- **Tests.** Unit tests never touch the network; use the `fake_http` fixture in
  `tests/conftest.py`, which runs real httpx over `httpx.MockTransport`, records each request
  and replays responses (`reply()`, or `queue()` for a sequence), or `stub_provider` to
  replace the provider behind a CLI test. Add a test for every
  behaviour change, and a regression test for every bug fix.
- **Triggers.** Keep existing trigger names working. Tests enforce the `-name-` shape, uniqueness
  and no prefix collisions.
- **Commits** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`,
  `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`.
- **Changelog.** Add a line under *Unreleased* in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for anything a user
  would notice.
- **Releases.** After tagging `vX.Y.Z`, run `uv run python scripts/update_match_history.py` and
  commit any change, so deploy keeps recognising every released match file.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, never by hand-made tags.

1. Open a `chore(release): X.Y.Z` pull request that sets `version` in `pyproject.toml`, runs
   `uv lock` (which updates the project's version in `uv.lock`), and renames `## Unreleased` in
   CHANGELOG.md to `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD` (the release date). Leave no empty *Unreleased*
   heading behind; the next change adds it back. `tests/test_release.py` fails unless the newest
   CHANGELOG version is the `pyproject.toml` version and every version heading is dated.
2. Merge it, then run the **release** workflow on `main` (Actions tab, or
   `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f dry-run=false`). It builds the sdist, the wheel and
   `constraints.txt` (`uv export --frozen --no-dev --no-emit-project --no-hashes`), installs the
   wheel with those constraints into a clean venv on macOS, Windows and Linux and runs
   `scripts/check_wheel.py --constraints`, then attests the files, creates the annotated tag
   `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the Release with that CHANGELOG section as its notes. *dry-run* is on by
   default and stops after the artifact tests; untick it to release. A dry run attests nothing,
   so it leaves no provenance record for files that were never released. The workflow releases
   only the current head of `main`, checked again just before tagging, and does nothing for a
   version that already has a published Release. If a release run fails half way, re-run it: an
   annotated tag already on the same commit and a draft Release are reused, while a tag on any
   other commit, or a lightweight one, stops it. The Release is marked *Latest* only when no
   published Release has a higher version.
3. Check the result: `gh release download vX.Y.Z` and `gh attestation verify <file> -R
   vlastimilbures/espanso-prompt-rewriter` for each file. The first real release is also the
   first check that attestation works end to end.

With the repository variable `RELEASE_ON_PUSH` set to `true`, step 2 also happens on every push
to `main` whose version has no published Release yet. It is off by default, so merging a branch
never releases by surprise. Only the workflow's last job can write (`contents`, `id-token`,
`attestations`). Release builds use the build backend pinned by `build-constraint-dependencies`
in `pyproject.toml`; bump that pin by hand.
The Release is created as a draft and published once every file is attached, so with
[immutable releases](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases)
enabled in the repository settings, the published Release cannot be changed.

One exception predates the workflow: 0.10.0 (commit `a15a2af`) never got a tag or a Release.
The owner backfills it once, by hand, from a checkout of `main`:

```bash
git tag -a v0.10.0 a15a2af -m "Release 0.10.0"
git push origin v0.10.0
python3 scripts/release_notes.py notes --release 0.10.0 > notes-0.10.0.md
gh release create v0.10.0 --verify-tag --latest=false --title v0.10.0 --notes-file notes-0.10.0.md
```

## Trigger start-up budget

Espanso starts a fresh `prompt-workflow` process for every trigger, so everything `cli.py`
imports is paid on each expansion. Measured on 2026-10-04 on an Apple M5 MacBook (macOS, load
average about 14, so on the high side), CLI 0.15.0:

| Measure | Python 3.12 | Python 3.14 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `import prompt_workflow.cli`, cumulative (`-X importtime`) | 128–138 ms | 164–207 ms |
| `prompt-workflow persona`, wall time (median of 15) | 185 ms | 238 ms |
| Modules the guarded trigger runs add to a bare interpreter | 293 | 294 |
| The same with the usage history recording (#89, 2026-10-05) | 307 | 306 |

The largest parts of the import are `importlib.metadata` (about 50 ms, for `__version__` in
`prompt_workflow/__init__.py`), httpx (about 30 ms) and Typer (about 19 ms). CI runner numbers
(Linux, Windows) are still to be recorded from a CI run.

Re-measure with:

```bash
uv run python -X importtime -c "import prompt_workflow.cli" 2>&1 | sort -t'|' -k2 -n | tail
uv run python -c "import subprocess, sys, time; t = time.perf_counter(); \
  subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'prompt_workflow.cli', 'persona'], check=True); \
  print(f'\n{(time.perf_counter() - t) * 1000:.0f} ms')"
```

The second line runs through `python -m`, as the installed `prompt-workflow` script does
apart from the launcher. Run either several times on an idle machine and take the median.

`tests/test_trigger_contract.py` guards the budget without timing anything, since wall-clock
tests flake on a loaded machine. It runs `improve` and `persona` in a fresh interpreter
(clipboard and argument input, a local and a cloud provider, a provider error and a settings
error) and fails if any of them imports `textual`, `rich.console`, `tomli_w`, `tomlkit`,
`keyring` or the deploy module, or if they add more than `MODULE_CEILING` (400) modules. It runs
them with the usage history on and off: on, the run is recorded after its output, so
`sqlite3` loads (307 modules on 3.12, 306 on 3.14); off (`PROMPT_HISTORY=false`), `sqlite3` and
`history` must not load at all (296). A new heavy
dependency belongs behind a lazy import in the command that needs it, never on the trigger
path. Raise the ceiling only with new measurements here.

## Common changes

### Add a profile

A profile for your own use does not belong in the repo: put it in the user profile directory,
`~/.config/prompt-workflow/profiles/<name>.md` (`%APPDATA%\prompt-workflow\profiles\` on
Windows), where an upgrade cannot replace it. See
[README](README.md#profiles-and-persona); a same-named file overrides a built-in only when
`PROMPT_PROFILE_OVERRIDES` lists it. `profiles.migrate_profiles()` copies profiles a checkout
added or edited under `src/prompt_workflow/prompts/` into that directory (it never deletes or
overwrites).

To ship a new built-in profile:

1. Add `src/prompt_workflow/prompts/<name>.md` containing the system prompt as plain prose. It is
   picked up automatically. The name must match `prompt_builder.PROFILE_NAME` (lower-case
   letters, digits, `-`, `_`).
2. Optionally include `{{PERSONA_RULE}}` where the user's persona should be applied (see
   `prompt_builder.render()`).
3. Add a test in `tests/test_prompts.py`.

### Add a trigger

Add a match to `espanso/match/prompts-llm.yml`. Shell commands start with the quoted
`__PROMPT_WORKFLOW__` placeholder, which `prompt-workflow espanso deploy` replaces with the absolute CLI path.
Quote nothing else: `cmd.exe` mangles a command line holding more than one quoted part.
Set `force_mode: clipboard` on every match that runs the CLI, so Espanso pastes the output
instead of typing short replies key by key.

```yaml
- trigger: "-ireg-"
  left_word: true  # fire only at the start of a word, never inside one such as n-i-1
  replace: "{{output}}"
  force_mode: clipboard
  vars:
    - name: output
      type: shell
      params:
        cmd: "\"__PROMPT_WORKFLOW__\" improve --provider ollama --profile regulation --source clipboard"
```

A match of your own runs without `--trigger-id`: the managed matches' ids are a fixed
allowlist, so the usage history records your trigger as `direct` (or, if you pass an id that
is not on it, as an unattributed managed run). A new managed trigger adds
its id to `recorder.TRIGGER_IDS` (the test fails until each CLI match passes its own).

Any change to a file in `espanso/match/` needs
`uv run python scripts/update_match_history.py` (also run it at every release, after tagging):
it records the source's digest in `src/prompt_workflow/match_history.py` (together with every
digest already listed, which is never dropped, each release tag's version and the file at every
commit that changed it on this branch and on the default branch, since an editable install
runs an untagged commit), so `espanso deploy`
later recognises a file this version wrote as its own (stale) rather than foreign, and
`tests/test_deploy.py` fails until it is run.

`tests/test_yaml.py` checks the placeholder, quoting and `force_mode`, and that the profile and
provider exist. Add the trigger's expected provider, profile and tier to `EXPECTED` in
`tests/test_triggers.py`, which replays every trigger's command line through the CLI. Pass
`--profile` only when the trigger needs a fixed profile: it overrides `PROMPT_PROFILE` and the
pro tier's profile.

### Add a setting

Add a field to `Settings` in `src/prompt_workflow/config.py` with `_env("NAME", "default")`, then
document it in the README configuration table and in `.env.example` (commented out with its
default: `# NAME=default`). `tests/test_docs.py` fails until both are done. A setting that holds
a secret takes `secret=True`: it then stays out of `repr()`, is saved only in the secret store,
and is never written to `config.toml`.

### Add a static snippet or form

Snippets that need no model go in `espanso/match/prompts-core.yml`, as plain Espanso matches
(`replace:` for fixed text, `form:` plus `form_fields:` for a fill-in form). See the
[Espanso docs](https://espanso.org/docs/matches/basics/). Test in a plain-text editor first.

### Add a provider

1. Implement `generate(prompt, system_prompt) -> str` (the `Provider` protocol) in
   `src/prompt_workflow/providers/`. Use `post_json()` and `finalize_content()` from
   `providers/base.py` so transport errors and `<think>` stripping behave like the other providers.
   Pass the response's raw stop reason to `finalize_content(..., stop_reason=...)`, so a cut-off,
   failed or filtered reply is marked instead of pasted as complete. Take an optional
   `observer` and, when it is set, pass `post_json(..., meter=Meter(...))` with a parser in
   `providers/usage.py` that maps the body's tokens and cost (a missing cost stays `None`).
2. Add it to `PROVIDER_NAMES` and `make_provider()` in `factory.py`, passing `observer`. If it can send data off the
   machine, return it through `_gate()`, as the other providers do, and make `_leaves_machine()`
   report it, so the gate and `PROMPT_LOCAL_ONLY` both cover it.
3. Add wire-format and error-path cases to `tests/test_providers.py`, and a factory test.

### Improve the redaction gate

Add a pattern to `_PATTERNS` in `src/prompt_workflow/redaction.py`, with a validator in
`_VALIDATORS` if the raw regex is too broad. Bound every repeat that can run over ordinary text
and match a value only for its existence (`{8}`, not `{8,}`), then add an input to
`test_scan_is_fast_on_adversarial_input`. Add a row to the `MUST_DETECT` corpus and a near-miss
row to `MUST_PASS` in `tests/test_redaction.py`; every bench draft must still scan clean. Rules
about the whole draft (like `bare_token`) belong in `scan_draft()`, which only the gate calls:
`safe_repr()` uses `scan()` and must keep quoting short setting values. Build fake keys at runtime (`"sk-ant-" + body`) so no key-shaped
literal lands in the repo. Patterns specific to one organisation belong in the user's
`PROMPT_EXTRA_PATTERNS`, not in the code.

### Change the default prompt

Template wording is scored by `scripts/bench_models.py`, and `tests/test_bench.py` checks the
scored phrases still exist in `prompts/default.md` and in the static `-p-` template
(`espanso/match/prompts-template.yml`), so change all three together. A/B a change on both the
standard and pro defaults, on both suites, before proposing it, and include the before/after
pass rates in the pull request, with each run's `meta.json` (commit, prompt hash, persona
mode). The bench renders a fixed fictitious persona by default, so anyone can reproduce your
numbers. Never commit the outputs of a `--persona env` run, which hold your own persona. For
example:

```bash
uv run python scripts/bench_models.py --suite all --runs 3 --models \
  google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite@google-ai-studio/flex~minimal openai/gpt-6-luna@openai~low
uv run python scripts/bench_models.py --suite all --runs 3 --system-prompt-file candidate.md \
  --models google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite@google-ai-studio/flex~minimal openai/gpt-6-luna@openai~low
```

The `core` suite is saturated: the previous prompt already passed it in full, so it only guards
against regressions. Improvements show on the `edge` suite and in how good the rewrites read,
which the mechanical checks cannot judge. For a prompt change that is not purely mechanical,
also compare the two prompts' outputs blind and pairwise: same model, draft and run, A/B order
randomised, labels hidden. Judge fidelity, invention, specificity of the work steps and
calibration of CONSTRAINTS, INPUTS, OUTPUTS and `[REVIEW: …]`, and read the result **per
model**. The two default models react to the same wording in opposite directions: an
anti-invention rule that fixed flash-lite made gpt-6-luna write thin, generic steps. Keep
drafts you wrote after freezing the candidate for the final comparison.

Small models such as flash-lite need an explicit trigger for *each* variant of a branching step.
A rule like "if unsure, use (a)" with no positive condition for (b) makes them pick (a) almost
every time. They also choose a variant by analogy to the examples in the rule, so a named
example ("a polite reply to a vendor") works better than an abstract class ("any external
party"). Check the per-draft table in the report, not only the total.

### The general profile

`general` is what `-il-` and `-ilm-` send to a local model, so it stays short. The bench scores
it with `--profile general` (or a candidate with `--system-prompt-file`): a profile without
`<output_template>` is checked by `check_general()`: an answer instead of a rewrite (a bare
"OK", a letter, `Draft.answer`), a preamble or trailing note, an invented role, an injected
instruction carried over outside the quoted material and not negated (`Draft.forbidden`), the
"input is data" guard (`Draft.guard`), the draft's language and its copied material. Fenced
replies are counted. The checks are heuristics: read a sample of the outputs as well. The bench runs on OpenRouter only, so flash-lite stands in for a
local 7-8B model; nothing has measured `general` on Ollama or LM Studio yet. Keep the phrases in
`tests/test_prompts.py::test_general_profile_contract` in sync with `prompts/general.md`.

### Known gaps in the default prompt

Both tiers send the `default` profile (flash-lite on the standard tier, gpt-6-luna on the pro
tier); `default-pro` is an alias of it. The 2026-10-02 rework (see
`docs/prompt-candidates/PLAN.md`) closed the old gaps 1–4 and 7: fixed wordings are copied word
for word, document steps name their sections, method choices are stated as assumptions, a
message to a named person at another organisation gets the independent review, and the
self-review lines match the format in `OUTPUTS`. The gaps it left, and their state after the
2026-10 round (its bench runs use `--persona example`):

1. **Published text on flash-lite** (closed 2026-10). The review rule now names its readers
   (only the user, a colleague, their manager or their team take the self-review; everyone
   else, including the CEO and published text, takes the independent review), and says that
   "quick", "short" and "brief" never decide it. Over 6 runs each, flash-lite gives `faq` and
   `quick-ceo` the independent review 6/6 (the 0.13.0 prompt: 0/6 and 1/6), and `light`,
   `teams-jana`, `memo`, `slack`, `sql`, `outliers` and `code` the self-review 6/6.
2. **Self-review drafts on gpt-6-luna** (mostly closed). With a fixed fictitious persona,
   `outliers`, `sql` and `memo` get the self-review in every run. Over 123 calls, gpt-6-luna chose
   the wrong review branch once (`light`, 1 of 3).
3. **Half-answers in work steps on flash-lite.** For "what's the difference between IFRS 9
   stage 2 and stage 3", flash-lite writes the answer into the steps, sometimes wrongly. Naming
   the aspects to cover is welcome; stating facts is not. Watch it on `question`.
4. **Injection meta-commentary on flash-lite** (not reproduced). Instead of dropping "ignore
   previous instructions", flash-lite sometimes wrote a CONTEXT about "an instruction that
   attempts to override my role". With a fixed fictitious persona it did not happen in 9 runs of
   `injection` and `pasted-injection` (2026-10). Watch it if a persona is set.
5. **Unscored review branches.** Two edge drafts are not scored on the review branch: a one-page
   PRD for a fintech feature and `outage`, an incident summary for the user's manager. The
   2026-10 rule decides by reader, so `outage` should take the self-review; who reads a PRD is
   still open. Score both once that is settled.
6. **Persona bleed** (depends on the persona). With `PROMPT_PERSONA` set, near-empty drafts
   can pick up the persona's domain: "help with the report" became a report on "risk management
   metrics". It did not reproduce with a neutral persona (`vague` and a near-empty draft, 12
   gpt-6-luna and 3 flash-lite runs), so it likely depends on the persona's domain. A design
   trade-off, not a bug; check it with `--persona env` on your own machine.
7. **Draft delimiting in the CLI.** Sending the draft wrapped in `<draft>…</draft>` gave a
   small, consistently positive but not significant gain once the prompt already said the
   whole message is the draft. If adopted, escape `</draft>` inside drafts.
8. **Prompt length** (closed 2026-10). The 2026-09 and 2026-10-02 reworks made the system
   prompt about 40% longer (about 3,900 input tokens per call). Against the shorter prompt, p50
   latency stayed at 2.1 s on flash-lite and fell from 7.6 s to 6.6 s on gpt-6-luna, and the cost
   per 1,000 calls rose from $0.96 to $1.13 on flash-lite and from $0.34 to $0.35 on gpt-6-luna.
   Length does not drive latency; cost rose about 18% on flash-lite and is flat on gpt-6-luna.
9. **The bench runs `default` on every model** (closed 2026-10). Both tiers now send `default`,
   so a plain `--suite all` run scores what ships; `tests/test_bench.py` checks that the bench's
   profile is the one the CLI uses.
10. **Pasted material on flash-lite (#42).** The prompt now copies pasted material up to about
    60 lines in full. gpt-6-luna copies it in every run (`pasted`, `outage`, `pasted-injection`,
    the 35-line `long-thread` and the 57-line `cap-thread`, 6/6 each). flash-lite copies
    `outage`, `pasted-injection` (6/6), `long-thread` and `cap-thread` (5/6), but still
    summarises the short email in `pasted` (5 of 6 runs). It also gives `long-thread` ("summarise
    this thread for me and draft my reply to Tomasz") the self-review in 6 of 6 runs, and
    `cap-thread` (a 5-bullet summary for the user's manager) the `.md` line in 6 of 6, where the
    bench expects a message. The 0.13.0 prompt did the same (`long-thread` 2 of 3, `cap-thread` 3
    of 3). The `OUTPUTS` rule treats a summary as a document, so the `cap-thread` failure may be
    the bench's expectation rather than the model's.

### Next steps for the default prompt

Limits of the 2026-10-02 and 2026-10 evaluations, and what to do next:

1. **Re-judge the shipped prompt blind on new drafts.** The 2026-10-02 `default` and
   `default-pro`, and the merged `default` of 2026-10, were checked mechanically only; the blind
   ranking was on I2. The revisions were tuned on the
   same 32 drafts, and `landlord` is no longer held out. Write 6–8 new drafts (outside emails,
   published text, internal memos, "for me" scripts) before changing anything else, and judge
   the current prompts against the previous release on both tiers.
2. **Use more runs per draft.** At 3 runs, a single draft flips between 0/3 and 2/3 from noise
   alone (seen on `big-personal` and `memo`). Re-check any single-draft change at 6 runs or more
   before acting on it.
3. **Fix gap 1 (published FAQ text on flash-lite).** Done in 2026-10: the review rule names
   its readers, and `quick-ceo` and `memo` held at 6/6.
4. **Fix gap 10 on flash-lite.** Find a wording that makes flash-lite copy a short pasted
   email and give a reply to an outside sender the independent review when the draft also says
   "for me". Check `pasted`, `long-thread` and `cap-thread` at 6 runs or more, and decide
   whether a summary for the user's manager should get the `.md` line.
5. **Keep one profile.** The profiles were merged in 2026-10 (gap 9). Before splitting them
   again, show that no single wording serves both models: one prompt per tier doubles the bench
   and review work.
6. **Watch the prompt length.** The prompt is now about 3,900 input tokens; check latency on the
   pro tier (6–9 s) after any further additions.
