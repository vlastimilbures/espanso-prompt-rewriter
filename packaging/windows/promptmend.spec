# PyInstaller spec for the frozen Windows build (#185): onedir, a console promptmend.exe
# with its _internal\ folder next to it, so a trigger never unpacks anything (onefile would,
# on every call). scripts/build_windows.py runs it and zips the result; run it from the repo
# root after `uv sync --locked --group build`.
#
# What a static import scan misses is collected by hand:
# - promptmend's own lazily imported modules (cli._LazyGroup imports commands.* by name);
# - textual's widgets (textual.widgets.__getattr__ imports them by name) and its data;
# - the package data: the profiles (prompts/*.md) and the Espanso match files, which the
#   wheel holds under promptmend/espanso/match (assets.match_dir() reads them there);
# - promptmend's metadata, which __version__ reads.
