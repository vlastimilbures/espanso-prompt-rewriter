"""Records each improve and persona run in the usage history (history.py), best effort.

A run is one operation, plus one attempt per HTTP attempt its provider made. The provider's
usage observer only collects the attempts in memory (it runs while Espanso waits, so it must
not do I/O); finish() writes the operation and all of them in one history transaction, after
the output was emitted and flushed. So the usage of a reply that was then rejected (content
validation, the --copy clipboard step) is kept, and nothing about history can change what
was printed, the exit code or whether the provider retried.

With PROMPT_HISTORY=false, or when the settings did not load (the setting is then unknown),
nothing is recorded and history.py, and with it sqlite3, is never imported.
