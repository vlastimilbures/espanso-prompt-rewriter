"""`shell` (#183): a line-based REPL for a terminal, with the completion and live help of
Home's command line in the interface (promptmend/console.py), for people who would rather not
use the full-screen interface. Enter runs the line as `promptmend …` in this terminal: a
command that asks (deploy, migrate, `secrets set NAME`) asks here, as on any terminal. Only
the triggers (`improve`, `persona`), a nested shell and a key typed on the line are refused;
a line that looks like it holds a key is never echoed or kept in the history (memory only,
never a file). prompt_toolkit is imported only once the shell opens, so --help, the triggers
and every other command never load it."""
