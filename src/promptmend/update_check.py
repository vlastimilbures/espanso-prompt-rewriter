"""Whether a newer release exists (#197), for `doctor` and the interface's Home, never for a
trigger (tests/test_trigger_contract.py).

One GET of PyPI's JSON for promptmend, at most once a day: the answer is cached in
user_data_dir()/update-check.json. A failed request is cached too, as ``"latest": null``, and
asked again only after RETRY_AFTER. PROMPT_UPDATE_CHECK=false makes no request and reads no
file. Every failure (network, a bad reply, a damaged cache) is ``unknown``; nothing raises.
