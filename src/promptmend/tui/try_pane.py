"""The Try tab (#111): rewrite a draft typed here, the way a trigger would, and read the
result before any trigger pastes one.

The draft is typed into the tab; the clipboard is never read or written. The rewrite runs in
process, in a worker thread, through cli.rewrite() (so the draft never appears in a command
line or the process list), and with it through factory.make_provider() and its
data-protection gate. By default it runs against the set-up smoke test's stub on 127.0.0.1
with a placeholder key: no provider is called and nothing is recorded. A real provider call
first asks, naming the provider and the model, and is then recorded in the usage history as
a direct call (no trigger), as `promptmend improve` typed in a terminal would be. The result
is shown as plain text, never read as markup.
