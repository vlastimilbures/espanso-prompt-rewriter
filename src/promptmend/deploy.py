"""Managed Espanso deployment: plan, apply and reverse what promptmend writes into
Espanso's `match/` folder (#86).

Each packaged match file (assets.py) is rendered with the launcher path and a version stamp,
compared with the manifest of what we deployed before and with what is on disk, and written
only after the caller confirms. A file the user edited is never overwritten silently, only
files we own are removed, and nothing is ever written to Espanso's `config/` (#37).

Imported lazily by the `espanso` commands, never on the trigger path.
