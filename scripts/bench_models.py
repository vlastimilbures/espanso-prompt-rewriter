"""Benchmark OpenRouter models on the `default` (golden template) profile.

With the shipped settings both tiers send `default` (PROMPT_PRO_PROFILE is empty), so a run
without --system-prompt-file scores what every OpenRouter trigger sends.

Scores every run mechanically: tag balance, mandatory steps, branch selection, scaffolding
leaks, the draft-specific expectations (language, role, OUTPUTS format) and degeneration.
Token counts and cost come from OpenRouter's own `usage` block, not from an estimate. Run
manually; nothing in the package imports this.

    uv run python scripts/bench_models.py
    uv run python scripts/bench_models.py --suite all --runs 3
    uv run python scripts/bench_models.py --models openai/gpt-4.1-nano --runs 1
    uv run python scripts/bench_models.py --models openai/gpt-6-luna@openai~low

By default a run renders the same fictitious persona (`--persona example`), so two runners get
the same system prompt whatever their own PROMPT_PERSONA. Every run writes meta.json (git SHA,
prompt hashes, persona mode) next to its outputs in bench-out/<UTC timestamp>/.

A spec is `model`, optionally `@provider-tag` to pin one endpoint and `~effort` to set
OpenRouter's reasoning effort (none/minimal/low/medium/high).

The `core` suite (default) is the 8 drafts the model choice was made on. The `edge` suite adds
28 drafts that probe what `core` cannot: prompt injection, questions, pasted material,
non-English drafts, a draft stating its own role, code, and outside readers that are only
implied. `edge` is not expected to pass in full; see CONTRIBUTING.md for its known gaps.
