# PromptMend

**Type a trigger, get a well-structured LLM prompt.** Copy a rough draft, type `-i-` anywhere,
and [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) replaces it with a precise, sectioned prompt rewritten by a
local or cloud model.

One small Python CLI, `promptmend`, sits behind every trigger. Espanso runs it when you type
the trigger. It reads your clipboard, checks the draft for sensitive content before anything
leaves your machine, and sends it to the model with the rewrite instructions. Espanso pastes
the result in place of the trigger. If something went wrong, you get a readable
`[promptmend: …]` message, never a blank.

It works the same on macOS and Windows, with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai),
[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com), [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or
[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai). A full-screen terminal interface and plain commands set it up
and manage it.

## Highlights

- **Golden-template rewrite.** Any draft becomes
  `CONTEXT / GOAL / INSTRUCTIONS / CONSTRAINTS / INPUTS / OUTPUTS`.
- **Two tiers.** `-i-` answers in seconds; `-ip-` uses a reasoning model for hard drafts.
- **Four providers.** OpenRouter, Anthropic, Ollama and LM Studio; fully local if you like.
- **Data-protection gate.** Keys, cards, IDs, emails and your own patterns never leave unless
  you override.
- **Your persona, once.** `PROMPT_PERSONA` opens every rewrite with your role.
- **Never a blank paste.** Errors arrive inline as `[promptmend: …]`.
- **Clean output.** No reasoning block, control characters or invisible Unicode.
- **Interface and commands.** A full-screen interface, headless commands and
  `promptmend doctor`.
- **Benchmarked defaults.** Models and prompt chosen by a bundled benchmark.

## Example

A one-line draft becomes a full golden-template prompt.

<details>
<summary>A draft and its rewrite</summary>

Draft on the clipboard:

```text
write a short board update on why customer churn went up last quarter, use the attached churn dashboard export
```

Pasted in its place (real output of the v0.19.0 prompt on its default model,
`google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` on `google-ai-studio/flex`, effort `minimal`, no persona,
generated 2026-10-06):

```text
<CONTEXT>
I need to write a short board update explaining why customer churn went up last quarter, using the attached churn dashboard export.
</CONTEXT>

<GOAL>
A concise, executive-level board update explaining the drivers of increased customer churn last quarter and the actions being taken.
</GOAL>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
1/ Execute, but state assumptions up front.
2/ Load and validate all inputs. If anything is missing, ambiguous, or contradictory, ask me up to 5 targeted questions before drafting; if step 1 says execute, state your assumption instead and ask only about a gap that blocks the task.
3/ Analyse the churn dashboard export to identify the trends, segments, and main drivers behind the churn increase last quarter.
4/ Draft the board update containing: an executive summary of the churn metrics, the primary causes identified in the data, and the mitigation steps.
5/ Use a separate agent with corporate governance and investor reporting domain knowledge if you can run one, otherwise review as an independent expert in that domain would: perform a critical review, check for errors, and ensure the output is complete and accurate, review formatting and clarity, and ensure the output is well structured and easy to read; summarize all issues and improvement points, validate them with me before implementing any changes.
6/ Flag material judgment calls or trade-offs and let me decide.
</INSTRUCTIONS>

<CONSTRAINTS>
- Keep it short: a brief update suitable for a board of directors.
- Tone: professional, objective, and analytical.
- Use only the data provided in the churn dashboard export and general business knowledge labelled as such.
- Out of scope: detailed tactical execution plans or historical data prior to last quarter.
</CONSTRAINTS>

<INPUTS>
Churn dashboard export [REVIEW: attach or paste the churn dashboard export data]
</INPUTS>

<OUTPUTS>
structured .md, well formatted with clear headings/subheadings
</OUTPUTS>
```

The prompt makes two choices independently. Here the model read "short" as one small task, so
step 1 is "execute now"; analysing an export first could also justify "plan first". The board
audience selected the independent-review step. A quick note to yourself would get a
self-review checklist instead.

## Requirements

- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/install/), installed and running.
- macOS or Windows. Linux works too, with `xclip`, `xsel` or `wl-clipboard`.
- An [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys) for `-i-`, or
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) for fully local use.
- Python 3.12 or later, which Homebrew or uv installs for you.

More: [docs/install.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/install.md#requirements).

## Install

**macOS**, with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap vlastimilbures/tap
brew trust --formula vlastimilbures/tap/promptmend
brew install vlastimilbures/tap/promptmend
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):
`uv tool install promptmend -c https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/releases/latest/download/constraints.txt`

**Windows**, in PowerShell or a Command Prompt:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex"
```

It needs no Python first: it installs uv if needed, then the latest release, and runs
`promptmend doctor`. Or with uv: see
[docs/install.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/install.md#windows).

**Linux**: use the uv line above, plus `xclip`, `xsel` or `wl-clipboard` for the clipboard.

To update, use the channel you installed with, then run `promptmend doctor`. Before you
uninstall, run `promptmend espanso detach`, or every trigger fails once the CLI is gone.

More: [docs/install.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/install.md)
(every channel, verifying a download, update, uninstall, upgrading from older versions).

## Quick start

1. Set it up in a terminal, or open the interface instead:

   ```bash
   promptmend setup
   promptmend                 # or the full-screen interface
   ```

   `setup` asks for the provider, the profile and the API key, then previews the Espanso
   match files and deploys them only if you agree. It ends with a test call against a local
   stub, never a paid call.
2. Copy a rough draft.
3. Type `-i-` in any text field. Wait a few seconds without typing or switching windows:
   Espanso pastes wherever the focus is when the answer arrives.
4. If anything is off, ask the doctor:

   ```bash
   promptmend doctor
   ```

More: [docs/install.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/install.md#set-up)
(`setup` options, migrating a `.env`) and
[docs/troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Fully local

The local triggers need no API key. Pull a model in [Ollama](https://ollama.com), or load one
in [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and enable its local server. Then use `-il-` (Ollama) or
`-ilm-` (LM Studio):

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b                            # the default OLLAMA_MODEL
promptmend config set PROMPT_LOCAL_ONLY true    # optional: refuse every cloud call
```

## Triggers

| Trigger | What it does | Provider |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `-i-` | Rewrites the clipboard into the golden template | OpenRouter |
| `-ip-` | The same rewrite on the pro tier (a reasoning model, slower) | OpenRouter |
| `-if-` | The same rewrite; a form picks model, effort, tokens and timeout | OpenRouter |
| `-iok-` | `-i-`, sent once despite a flagged label, ID, email or IBAN | OpenRouter |
| `-il-` | General prompt improvement, fully local | Ollama |
| `-ilm-` | General prompt improvement, fully local | LM Studio |
| `-p-` | An empty golden template to fill in, opening with your persona | — |
| `-risk-` | An enterprise-risk analysis prompt scaffold | — |

- A trigger fires only at the start of a word, never inside `a[n-i-1]`.
- It sends whatever is on the clipboard, so copy the draft first.
- Do not type or switch windows while it runs. Or set `PROMPT_OUTPUT=clipboard` to get the
  rewrite on the clipboard instead.

More: [docs/usage.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/usage.md)
(profiles per trigger, clipboard output, the `-if-` form, your own triggers).

## Key commands

| `promptmend shell` | A command line with completion and live help, run in your terminal |
| `promptmend setup` | First run: provider, profile, key, match files and a smoke test |
| `promptmend doctor` | Checks the install, settings, keys, Espanso, match files and history |
| `promptmend config show` | Every setting, its value and where it comes from |
| `promptmend config set NAME VALUE` | Saves a setting after checking it |

(every option, the scripting contract, exit codes).

## Configuration

Settings live in `config.toml` and API keys in `secrets.toml`, both in the config folder. Each
setting is named like an environment variable, and a real environment variable wins over the
files.

| OS | Config folder (settings, keys, profiles) | Data folder (usage history) |
|----|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| macOS | `~/.config/promptmend/` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) | `~/.local/share/promptmend/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`) |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\promptmend\` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\promptmend\` |
| Linux | `~/.config/promptmend/` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) | `~/.local/share/promptmend/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`) |

Change them with `promptmend config set`, or in the interface's
[Settings tab](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/interface.md#settings-tab).
The common changes:

```bash
promptmend config set OPENROUTER_MODEL google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite      # the -i- model
promptmend config set PROMPT_PERSONA "I am working as a Head of Data at Example Corp."
promptmend config set PROMPT_OUTPUT clipboard   # copy the rewrite instead of pasting it
promptmend config set PROMPT_LOCAL_ONLY true    # refuse every cloud call
promptmend config set PROMPT_HISTORY false      # keep no usage history
```

A change applies to the next trigger, with no redeploy. Keys go in with
`promptmend secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, never as an argument. Settings still in a `.env`
move over with `promptmend config migrate`, after a preview.

More: [docs/configuration.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)
(all settings, files and folders) and
[docs/profiles.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/profiles.md)
(persona, your own profiles).

## Privacy

Cloud triggers send your clipboard to OpenRouter (and the endpoint that serves the model) or
to Anthropic. So does Ollama or LM Studio at another address, or an Ollama `cloud` model. Each
such call carries:

- the draft, after the data-protection gate and the removal of invisible characters;
- the system prompt: the profile's instructions and your persona, which the gate does not scan;
- the model name and request settings;
- the API key, only as the authentication header of its own provider.

The gate blocks keys, tokens, passwords, payment cards, Vietnamese national IDs, emails, IBANs,
confidentiality labels and your own patterns. `-iok-` sends one flagged draft on purpose when
every finding is a label, ID, email or IBAN.

`PROMPT_LOCAL_ONLY=true` refuses every cloud call, and the local triggers keep everything on
your machine. On macOS and Windows, clipboard items a password manager marks as concealed are
refused. The usage history is metadata only and never leaves this device.

**The gate is a heuristic safety net, not a compliance control: use cloud triggers only where
your organisation's policy allows.**

More: [docs/privacy.md](https://github.com/vlastimilbures/promptmend/blob/main/docs/privacy.md)
(what is sent and to whom, what the gate blocks, clipboard safety, usage history).

## Model benchmark

A bundled benchmark chose the defaults. It scores every rewrite mechanically for template
fidelity, prompt injection, language edge cases, latency and real cost. `-i-` runs
`google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` on `google-ai-studio/flex` (effort `minimal`). `-ip-` runs
`openai/gpt-6-luna` on `openai` (effort `low`).

(the scores, timings and costs, and how to run it).
